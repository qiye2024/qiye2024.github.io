I'm a Ph.D. student in Marine and Environmental Sciences at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu), working under the guidance of [Prof. Cristina Schultz](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/cristina-schultz/). Before landing in Boston, I worked as a research assistant at [Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology](http://english.niglas.cas.cn), Chinese Academy of Sciences. I did my undergrad at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) and my master's at [China University of Geosciences (Beijing)](https://en.cugb.edu.cn/).

At Northeastern, my research focuses on environmental data science and coastal biogeochemistry, particularly benthic-pelagic interactions and nutrient flux dynamics in estuarine systems. The fundamental questions of my research are:

1. How do long-term trends and modeling approaches quantify biogeochemical processes in Plum Island Estuary?
2. How do nutrient fluxes, oxygen dynamics, and sediment properties in PIE compare to other Northeastern U.S. estuaries?
3. What are the connectivity patterns among different coastal systems, and how do extreme events influence estuarine dynamics?

By integrating long-term observational data, numerical models, and machine learning, my research synthesizes benthic fluxes (carbon, oxygen, nutrients), sediment properties, and water column observations to enhance our understanding of benthic-pelagic coupling and provide guidance for long-term estuarine monitoring and data integration.
