<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I’m a Ph.D. student in Marine and Environmental Sciences at <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Northeastern University</a>, working under the guidance of <a href="https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/cristina-schultz/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Cristina Schultz</a>. Before landing in Boston, I worked as a research assistant at <a href="http://english.niglas.cas.cn" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology</a>, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I did my undergrad at <a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Zhejiang University</a> and my master’s at <a href="https://en.cugb.edu.cn/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">China University of Geosciences (Beijing)</a>.</p> <p>At Northeastern, my research focuses on environmental data science and coastal biogeochemistry, particularly benthic-pelagic interactions and nutrient flux dynamics in estuarine systems. The fundamental questions of my research are:</p> <ol> <li>How do long-term trends and modeling approaches quantify biogeochemical processes in Plum Island Estuary?</li> <li>How do nutrient fluxes, oxygen dynamics, and sediment properties in PIE compare to other Northeastern U.S. estuaries?</li> <li>What are the connectivity patterns among different coastal systems, and how do extreme events influence estuarine dynamics?</li> </ol> <p>By integrating long-term observational data, numerical models, and machine learning, my research synthesizes benthic fluxes (carbon, oxygen, nutrients), sediment properties, and water column observations to enhance our understanding of benthic-pelagic coupling and provide guidance for long-term estuarine monitoring and data integration.</p> </body></html>
