I Served as the instructor of 2 sections of Lab for Biostatistics (ENVR 2501), an undergraduate course with 19 students each.
Each week, I gave a one-hour lecture per section on advanced statistical methods in R (Bayesian/frequentist approaches, linear/generalized linear models, mixed-effects models, multivariate statistics, and ensemble modeling), followed by a two-hour Q&A session. During these sessions, I provided hands-on instruction and worked closely with the students on real-world data analysis to ensure that they developed strong practical skills in R.
