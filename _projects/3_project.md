As a research assistant working with Prof. Kaining Chen and Prof. Xiaoli Shi, I focused on exploring the relationships between phytoplankton and the water column in lakes and reservoirs. In these projects, I:
1. Investigated the mechanisms behind algal blooms caused by changes in nutrient concentrations, meteorological and hydrological conditions using long-term monitoring data series.
2. Studied the impact of global warming on drinking water sources.
