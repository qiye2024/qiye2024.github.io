The title of my undergradâ€™s thesis is Hormesis Response of Polychlorinated Biphenyls to Escherichia Coli. Under the guidance of Prof. Chaofeng Shen, I:
1. Established a microplate based, high throughput test method for E. coli growth.
2. Identified the types of PCBs that can show the hormesis response on E. coli growth and investigated the mechanisms.
