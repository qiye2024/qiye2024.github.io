The title of my masterâ€™s thesis is An Improved Method for Precise Selenium Isotope Determination. Under the guidance of Prof. Jianming Zhu, I:
1. Improved the testing method for precise selenium isotope determination.
2. Tested and reported the selenium isotope ratios of a series of standard samples.
