As a Ph.D. student working with Prof. Cristina Schultz, I’m dedicated to evaluating the influence of benthic processes and terrestrial input on coastal nutrient cycles and water quality, with a focus on the estuaries in the northeastern United States, starting with Plum Island Estuary (PIE). In particular, I am:
1. Compiling and integrating data from long-term observational records, hydrological datasets, and high-resolution ocean biogeochemistry models to build a comprehensive database for analyzing nutrient fluxes, oxygen dynamics, and sediment properties.
2. Investigating the relationships among key environmental factors in PIE, particularly the role of benthic processes in regulating nutrient cycling and oxygen availability.
3. Comparing patterns across estuaries by examining how PIE’s nutrient fluxes, oxygen dynamics, and sediment properties differ from other northeastern U.S. estuaries, while exploring connectivity between these coastal systems.
4. Assessing the impact of extreme events (e.g., storms, heatwaves) on estuarine dynamics and developing guidelines for future long-term monitoring and data integration to improve our understanding of estuarine resilience.
