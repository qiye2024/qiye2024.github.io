  abstract={Environmental bacteria contain a wealth of untapped potential in the form of biodegradative genes. Leveraging this potential can often be confounded by a lack of understanding of fundamental survival strategies, like dormancy, for environmental stress. Investigating bacterial dormancy-to-degradation relationships enables improvement of bioremediation. Here, we couple genomic and functional assessment to provide context for key attributes of the organic pollutant-degrading strain Rhodococcus biphenylivorans TG9. Whole genome sequencing, pangenome analysis and functional characterization were performed to elucidate important genes and gene products, including antimicrobial resistance, dormancy, and degradation. Rhodococcus as a genus has strong potential for degradation and dormancy, which we demonstrate using R. biphenylivorans TG9 as a model. We identified four Resuscitation-promoting factor (Rpf) encoding genes in TG9 involved in dormancy and resuscitation. We demonstrate that R. biphenylivorans TG9 grows on fourteen typical organic pollutants, and exhibits a robust ability to degrade biphenyl and several congeners of polychlorinated biphenyls. We further induced TG9 into a dormant state and demonstrated pronounced differences in morphology and activity. Together, these results expand our understanding of the genus Rhodococcus and the relationship between dormancy and biodegradation in the presence of environmental stressors.},

  abstract={Submerged plants constitute a vital component of shallow lake ecosystems, where water depth and sediment nitrogen‑phosphorus content are two key factors influencing their growth. This study focuses on Vallisneria natans and investigates the morphological and physiological changes of V. natans under the interaction of three water depth gradients and two different sediment nutrient levels. It explores the mechanisms through which varying sediment nutrient conditions under different water depths affect the growth of V. natans. The results indicate that both independent and interactive effects of water depth and sediment nutrient status significantly impact the morphology, antioxidant enzyme activity, and photosynthetic pigment content of V. natans, with water depth having a greater influence. To adapt to increased water depth-induced light stress, V. natans responds morphologically by increasing leaf length, leaf width, and decreasing maximum root length. Physiologically, it enhances its antioxidant regulation capacity and photosynthetic efficiency by increasing antioxidant enzyme activity, root vitality, and photosynthetic pigment content to counter weak light stress. However, these adaptations are insufficient to cope with excessively deep waters (200 cm). Sediment nutrient levels primarily control the growth of V. natans by affecting its root system. When sediment nitrogen and phosphorus content is lower, V. natans exhibits greater total root volume and surface area to enhance nutrient absorption efficiency. Water depth not only directly influences the growth of submerged plants but may also impact the migration and transformation of phosphorus in sediments, further exacerbating its effects on the growth of these plants, thus accelerating the regime shift of shallow lakes. Therefore, this study reveals V. natans' response strategies to varying water depths and sediment nutrient levels, determining suitable water levels and sediment nutrient conditions for its growth. These research findings provide a scientific basis for water level management and ecological restoration of submerged aquatic plants in shallow lakes.},

  abstract={Understanding the response of the phytoplankton community to climate change is essential for reservoir management. We analyzed a long-term data series (2009–2020) on the phytoplankton community in a large mesotrophic reservoir in the wet season to investigate the impacts of temperature and precipitation increases caused by climate change on the functioning and trait composition of the phytoplankton community. Over the last twelve years, the 3-month accumulative precipitation increased from 291.03 mm to 590.91 mm, and the surface water temperature increased from 25.06 °C to 26.49 °C in wet season, respectively. These changes caused a higher water level, stronger thermal stratification and lower nitrogen concentration in Daxi Reservoir. The dynamic equilibrium model indicated that the increased precipitation and water temperature-related environmental changes would result in a more diverse and productive phytoplankton community. The effects of increasing water temperature and precipitation on the niche complementarity and selection effects within the phytoplankton community were analyzed using structural equation model by means of the functional divergence index and functional evenness index, respectively, elucidating the reasons for the increase in cyanobacteria in the absence of a significant increase in nutrient levels. Based on these results, it is advisable that more stringent phosphorus control standards might be conducted to reduce the risks of cyanobacteria proliferation in the context of global warming.},

  abstract={Global warming has caused an increase in the frequency and duration of droughts worldwide. Droughts could trigger large changes in physico-chemical conditions and phytoplankton community in waterbodies, resulting in a shift in the phytoplankton community. Spring diatom blooms in reservoirs have been increasingly observed in the past decade in the Taihu Lake basin. The aim of the present study is to elucidate the impacts of droughts on aquatic environment and to determine the driving factors for the succession of the phytoplankton functional groups based on the analysis of data collected during spring from 2009 to 2020 in the Daxi Reservoir. The unimodal relationship between 1-month aggregated precipitation index and phytoplankton species richness indicated the competitive exclusion occurred in extremely drought period. The structural equation modeling indicated that drought-related low water level conditions intensified sediment resuspension, and increased the phosphorus-enriched nonalgal turbidity in the Daxi Reservoir. Concurrently, a steady shift in the Reynolds phytoplankton functional groups from L0, TD, J, X2, and A (phytoplankton taxa preferring low turbidity and nutrient conditions) to TB (pennate diatoms being adapt to turbid and nutrient-rich conditions) was observed. The increased TP and non-algal turbidity in addition to the lowered disturbance contribute to the prevalence of Group TB. Considering the difficulties in nutrient control, timely water replenishment is often a feasible method of controlling the dominance of harmful algae for reservoir management. Finally, alternative water sources are in high demand for ensuring ecological safety and water availability when dealing with drought.},
