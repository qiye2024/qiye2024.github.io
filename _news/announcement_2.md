On the final day of the College of Science Summer Skills Session, Qi Ye had the opportunity to present his PhD research journey to fellow PhD students from various departments. 

During the presentation, Qi outlined the key aspects of his doctoral research, focusing on coastal biogeochemistry and estuarine nutrient dynamics. He discussed his work on quantifying biogeochemical trends in the Plum Island Estuary, comparing regional estuarine patterns across the Northeastern U.S., and assessing coastal system connectivity in response to extreme events. The presentation also highlighted the integration of long-term observational data, numerical modeling, and machine learning to better understand benthic-pelagic coupling and nutrient fluxes in estuarine systems.

The session concluded with an engaging discussion, where participants from different scientific backgrounds exchanged perspectives on research methodologies, data analysis approaches, and interdisciplinary collaboration. This event marked a successful conclusion to the Summer Skills Session, reinforcing the importance of scientific communication, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and knowledge sharing within the College of Science.
